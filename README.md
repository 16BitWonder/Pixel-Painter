# Pixel-Painter
My first 3DS homebrew application, made heavily from referencing the examples; read-controls, colored-text, and both-screen-text that came with devkitpro. All three done by Aurelio Mannara for ctrulib. 

Features: 
- The ability to draw with six different colors on the bottom screen
- Sloppy begginer source code.
