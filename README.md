# Pixel-Painter
My first 3DS homebrew application, made heavily from referencing the examples; hello-world, colored-text, both-screen-text, and read-controls that came with devkitpro. All four done by Aurelio Mannara for ctrulib. 

Features: 
- The ability to draw with six different colors on the bottom screen
- Current information on top screen; e.g. Current coords, current color, 
  and whether erasing/drawing
- Sloppy begginer source code.
